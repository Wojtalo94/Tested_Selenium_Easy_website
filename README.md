# Tested_Selenium_Easy_website

Hello,

I just finished testing the "https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/" website.

All tests were done manually using TestRail. 

Apart from the results in pdf and XML files to import to TestRail, I also added a test report.

The next repository will be for automatic tests of the same page using the Selenium IDE program.
