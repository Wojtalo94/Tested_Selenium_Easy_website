# Tested_Selenium_Easy_website

Hello,

I just finished testing the "https://www.seleniumeasy.com/test/" website.
All tests were done manually using TestRail. 

Test Run_9-4-2020 file is a test report.

TestRail_to_import is a file that can be imported into TestRail.

TestRail is a file that describes the test scenario, test cases and defect reports. (C1 - C35 test scenario, C36-C150 test cases, after C150 there are defect raports).
